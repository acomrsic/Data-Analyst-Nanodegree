# Data Analyst Nanodegree
Data Analyst Nanodegree project solutions. 

Project: Test a Perceptual Phenomenon
In this project, I use descriptive statistics and a statistical test to analyze the Stroop effect, a classic result of experimental psychology.

Project: Wrangle and Analyze Data
Real-world data rarely come clean. Using Python, I gather data from a variety of sources, assess its
quality and tidiness, then clean it. l document wrangling efforts in a Jupyter Notebook, plus
showcase them through analyses and visualizations using Python and SQL.

Project: Explore and Summarize Data 
In this project, I use R and apply exploratory data analysis techniques to explore a selected data set for
distributions, outliers, and anomalies.

Project: Create a Tableau Story 
In this project, I create a data visualization, using Tableau, from a data set that tells a story or highlights
trends or patterns in the data.
